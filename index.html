<h1>Powerlifting: Bar Goes Up or I Do</h1>

<p>
    <b>Powerlifting</b> is not safe. It is not comfortable.
    It is a <span class="highlight-red">do-or-die moment</span>.
    When the bar is loaded, there are only two outcomes:
    <span class="highlight-yellow">either the bar goes up, or you go down trying</span>.
</p>

<h2>Built Under Pressure</h2>

<p>
    This sport has no mercy.
    Ankles have folded. Knees have failed.
    Careers have ended under a single bad rep.
</p>

<p>
    Every heavy session teaches the same lesson:
    your body adapts slower than your ego.
</p>

<p>
    Powerlifting doesn't reward fear —
    <span class="highlight-red">it exposes it</span>.
</p>

<h2>The Mental Cost of Heavy Weight</h2>

<p>
    The hardest part of powerlifting is not the weight.
    It is stepping toward the bar knowing exactly what it can take from you.
</p>

<p>
    Heavy attempts live in your head.
    Sleep gets lighter. Focus sharpens.
    Every rep becomes a negotiation with risk.

<h2>First National-Level Reality Check</h2>

<p>
    The <b>ALL INDIA INTER IIIT SPORTS MEET</b> at <b>IIITDM Kancheepuram</b>
    stripped illusions away.
    I totaled <b>435 kg</b> and earned a <b>Bronze Medal</b>.
</p>

<p>
    Everyone was strong.
    What separated results was judgment under fatigue.

<h2>When the Stakes Got Higher</h2>

<p>
    By <b>2025</b>, the weight carried expectations —
    not just from others, but from myself.
</p>

<p>
    Training became quieter.
    Fewer words. More intent.
</p>

<p>
    I totaled <b>490 kg</b> and secured a <b>Silver Medal</b>.

<h2>Owning the Platform</h2>

<p>
    Over four years, I progressed from <b>420 kg</b> to <b>520 kg</b>,
    setting the highest total in college history.
</p>

<p>
    Dominance came from repetition, recovery, and restraint.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bench Press: 120 kg</li>
    <li>Squat: 180 kg</li>
    <li>Deadlift: 220 kg</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building Champions Beyond Myself</h2>

<p>
    The most unexpected chapter came not from my own lifts,
    but from the athletes trained under my guidance.
    <img src="./grouppic.png" alt="Lift" width="50%">
</p>

<p>
    A group of female lifters — trained personally —
    stepped into powerlifting with no expectations placed on them.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>1 Gold Medal</b></li>
    <li><b>3 Silver Medals</b></li>
    <li><b>2 Bronze Medals</b></li>
    <li><b>3 Trophies from powerlifting alone</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
    These results were never predicted.
    Not across sports. Not from the female category.
</p>

<p>
    What they proved is simple:
    strength responds to preparation — not stereotypes.
</p>

<h2>Discipline Over Motivation</h2>

<p>
    Motivation fades.
    Discipline remains.
</p>

<p>
    Powerlifting rewards those who respect process over hype.
</p>
</div>

<div class="panel">
<h2>Final Rep</h2>

<p>
    Powerlifting does not promise longevity.
    It promises honesty.
</p>

<p>
    The platform remembers.
    The numbers stay.
    And the lessons extend beyond the bar.
